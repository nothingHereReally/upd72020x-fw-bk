backup of [upd72020x-fw](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/upd72020x-fw) from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org)
this is also a fork from [upd72020x-fw](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/upd72020x-fw)
due to as of may 13 2025 the [upd72020x-fw](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/upd72020x-fw)
is missing a file uPD72020x-Firmware-1.0.0.tar.gz, due to it has a dependency to this
[repo](https://github.com/denisandroid/uPD72020x-Firmware) which is not found
and seems to be deleted by the owner of that [repo](https://github.com/denisandroid/uPD72020x-Firmware)


this is the xhci_pci firmware, this has mainly been tested on Arch GNU/Linux
I don't if this works for other GNU/Linux distro, this package solves the
problem of `==> WARNING: Possibly missing firmware for module: 'xhci_pci'`
or `==> WARNING: Possibly missing firmware for module: 'xhci_pci_renesas'`
for more info see [missing firmware on Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mkinitcpio#Possibly_missing_firmware_for_module_XXXX)
